    "FAQ_Q1_TITLE": "What is the purpose of our stress detection system?",
    "FAQ_Q1_ANSWER": "Our system uses algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks to monitor user data, such as heart rate, oxygenation, sleep patterns, and physical activity, to detect stress. This data is obtained through smartwatches or wearable devices and is processed to provide real-time stress alerts.",
    "FAQ_Q2_TITLE": "How does the keyboard algorithm detect stress?",
    "FAQ_Q2_ANSWER": "The keyboard-based stress detection algorithm analyzes the pattern of specific keys that the user presses while typing. Changes in speed, frequency, or type of keys can indicate elevated stress levels. This information helps complement the data obtained from wearable devices.",
    "FAQ_Q3_TITLE": "How is user context obtained for alerts?",
    "FAQ_Q3_ANSWER": "We use customized tests and analysis of obtained data to better understand each user's context. This allows generating more specific alerts, adapted to each individual's situation and stress level.",
    "FAQ_Q4_TITLE": "Can the system predict stress events?",
    "FAQ_Q4_ANSWER": "Yes, through continuous data analysis, the system can detect patterns that precede a stressful event, allowing anticipation of possible episodes and recommending preventive actions.",
    "FAQ_Q5_TITLE": "Is the system compatible with different devices?",
    "FAQ_Q5_ANSWER": "Yes, our system is compatible with a wide range of smart devices, such as watches and wristbands, that allow the integration of real-time biometric data for stress analysis.",
    "FAQ_Q6_TITLE": "What are the benefits of this system for users?",
    "FAQ_Q6_ANSWER": "The system helps users identify early signs of stress, allowing them to take preventive measures. Additionally, it improves personal wellness management by providing accurate data about their physical and mental state.",
    "FAQ_Q7_TITLE": "Can I use the system if I don't have a smart device?",
    "FAQ_Q7_ANSWER": "Although smart devices are a key source of data, the system can also analyze other behavioral factors, such as keyboard usage, to assess stress levels, making it accessible even without wearable devices.",
    "FAQ_Q8_TITLE": "How does the system ensure user data privacy?",
    "FAQ_Q8_ANSWER": "User data privacy is our priority. We use advanced security protocols to ensure that all collected information, both from devices and keyboard interactions, is encrypted and treated confidentially. Additionally, users have complete control over their data.",
